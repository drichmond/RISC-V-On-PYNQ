        The following lines enable a PYNQ-Like API for Overlays. For
        example, without these lines you cannot call
        streamOverlay('stream.bit') if stream.bit is not in the PYNQ
        package. because stream.bit is not on the bitstream search
        path. 

        This class fixes that by searching the location of subclass
        definition if an absolute path is not provided.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bitfile : str
            The bitstream name or absolute path as a string.
        download : boolean or None
            Whether the overlay should be downloaded. If None then the
            overlay will be downloaded if it isn't already loaded.

        Note
        ----
        This class requires a Vivado '.tcl' file to be next to bitstream file
        with same name (e.g. base.bit and base.tcl).
